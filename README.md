# string

A dynamic string library for C

This library defines the struct `String`, which is meant to be used to handle heap allocated strings.

# Dependencies

This library depends on my [string view library](https://github.com/nikos-alexandris/str_view).

# Quick Start

Clone the str_view repo and this repo into the same directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nikos-alexandris/str_view
git clone https://github.com/nikos-alexandris/string
```

and simply include the `string.h` header

 ```c
 #include "string/string.h"
 ```
